# Laravel Task Management App

This is a Laravel 11-based web application for managing users, tasks, and categories. Built with clean architecture and modern tooling, it serves as a solid foundation for secure and scalable Laravel development.
Originally created as part of my self-directed learning journey, this project goes beyond basic experimentation. It reflects my ability to independently learn, apply best practices, and deliver organized, maintainable code â€” showcasing both my backend development skills and my commitment to professional growth.
